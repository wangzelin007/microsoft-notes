Thanks for join the meeting to help us troubleshoot the issue.
Let me introduce background, azure cli is a open source project, we have dozens modules.
And every day we need to check all the new issues and route them to different service team or cli team.
So we add some task to check the title and content in every issue, and based on the result, route to different teams.
For example, in this task we check if the title or content contains a CLI command az network, then we will route to the Azure CLi network team.
All these tasks are very similar, the different between them is the search pattern and the team name.
But we found these tasks not worked as we expected most of the time.
I will show you three different behaviours.
The first one works very well, search az aks, and notify CXP team.
The second one search az storage, but not work, until we add the storage label manually, it finishes other steps automatically.
The Third one search az network, also not work, but if we close and reopen the issue, will take effect.
