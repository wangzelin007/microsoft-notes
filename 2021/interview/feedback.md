1. Good English skills, all programming questions are described in English, and candidates can quickly understand.
2. Not familiar with basic CS problem，such as: TCP UDP HTTP protocol, database, linux system.
3. Insufficient coding ability, barely complete a simple coding problem.

Project experience: The candidate is mainly focus on research work, but does not have much experience on Engineering and Coding
Computer Fundamental: The candidate cannot explain some basic concepts like database index and TCP connection flow.
Algorithm & Code: The candidate can provide the algorithm with my hint, but did not write out the right code and the code structure is disordered.

<Name> and I discussed a service(back-end plus API) to validate feedback verbatims for foul language.
Technical excellence:
<name> demonstrated knowledge of technical concepts necessary to build services, though not distributed ones.
She understood the necessity of testing and quality and provided many ways to ensure service quality.
She planned continuous improvements for the service.
Some examples:
collect some incoming verbatims which where marked by the services as "not clean" and then use them
for testing the service after changes; slow and safe service release via rings;
message queue monitoring with alerts.
Drive for Results:
<name> asked a lot of question to check her understanding of the task, also she sought confirmation
for some ideas when she wasn't sure about them.
She easily incorporated feedback or new facts about the service into her thinking.
Collaboration:
<name> looked like a good team player.
She was ready to collect feedback and ideas from people immediately around her and from the whole org.
if necessary. Some examples:
when given someone else's code, she wanted to contact previous code owner and talk to them about design decisions.
<Name> 和我讨论了一项服务（后端加 API）来验证粗言秽语的逐字反馈。
技术卓越：<name> 展示了构建服务所需的技术概念知识，尽管不是分布式服务。她了解测试和质量的必要性，并提供了许多确保服务质量的方法。她计划不断改进服务。
一些例子：收集一些被服务标记为“不干净”的传入逐字记录，然后在更改后使用它们来测试服务；通过环缓慢而安全地释放服务；带有警报的消息队列监控。
追求结果：<name> 问了很多问题来检查她对任务的理解，当她不确定一些想法时，她也会寻求确认。她很容易将有关该服务的反馈或新事实纳入她的想法中。
合作：<name> 看起来是一个很好的团队合作者。她准备好从她周围的人和整个组织中收集反馈和想法。
如有必要。一些例子：当给别人的代码时，她想联系以前的代码所有者并与他们讨论设计决策。
