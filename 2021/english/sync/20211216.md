I almost finished the CLI Command Coverage Report.
And vendors are adding test cases based on the command coverage report.
And I will continuously improve the accuracy of coverage.
Now we can support two level coverage, one is command level and second is argument level.
And I also want to add a new check in CLI azdev linter check, to compare the current commit branch with dev branch to detect
whether the developer needs to add test cases in their commit. This feature was raised during discussion with YuChen.
