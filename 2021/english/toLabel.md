Hope you’re safe and doing good.  
I am following up on this case as I haven’t heard back from you in a while and I am concerned about your case being idle.  
Please let me know, if you need any support from Microsoft. Or if the issue is resolved, please confirm if I can close the case.  
May I ask could you add scenario tests for these new commands?
Our release day is the end of each month, so I will move it to the next milestone on the 20th of each month before this feature is GA.
