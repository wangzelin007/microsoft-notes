Hi @Lily,

Yu is on paternity leave.
Can you set up a meeting at ETC: 2021-12-7 Tuesday 18:00 ?
In Shanghai the time is: 2021-12-8 Wednesday 7:00.

There are three things I really want to know.
1. How do I configure the bot and make it effective.
2. Is it possible to specify a certain branch and a certain repo to take effect on, so that I can conveniently test without affecting existing functions.
3. Except o	Auto add a comment based on template to avoid issue response SLA, Can all other functions be supported by the bot?

Thank you for your kind cooperation.

Best wishes,
Zelin
