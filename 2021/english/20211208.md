Hi @Lily,

Yu is on paternity leave.
Can you set up a meeting at ETC: 2021-12-7 Tuesday 18:00 ?
In Shanghai the time is: 2021-12-8 Wednesday 7:00.

There are three things I really want to know.
1. How do I configure the bot and make it effective.
2. Is it possible to specify a certain branch and a certain repo to take effect on, so that I can conveniently test without affecting existing functions.
3. Except o	Auto add a comment based on template to avoid issue response SLA, Can all other functions be supported by the bot?

Thank you for your kind cooperation.

Best wishes,
Zelin

Questions:
1. Can you give me access to configure bot rules in those repos ? 
2. Can you look around all the enhancements and tell me which one can be supported by the bot ?

5. Except [ o Auto add a comment based on template to avoid issue response SLA ] , 
   Can all other enhancements be supported by the bot?

Answer:
1. I think we will give up since SLA don’t count bot comments
2. The only different between Fabric Bot and MSFT Bot is that the former is an internal name and the latter is the public facing name.
   So they are actually the same bot.

You can leverage(改变) the rules that the bot current has and also add the enhancements below.
