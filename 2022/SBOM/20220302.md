1. We require packages like azure-mgmt-resource, but these packages are missing from the built artifact (Contact OpenSourceEngSupport)

Component governance: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_componentGovernance/186704?_a=components&typeId=8943360&alerts-view-option=active
According to the meeting with SBOM, they are using: https://github.com/microsoft/component-detection

And actually, we have four setup.py file: 
https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/src/azure-cli/setup.py
https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/src/azure-cli-telemetry/setup.py
https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/src/azure-cli-core/setup.py
https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/src/azure-cli-testsdk/setup.py （should not include）

And three requirements file:
https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/src/azure-cli/requirements.py3.Darwin.txt
https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/src/azure-cli/requirements.py3.Linux.txt
https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/src/azure-cli/requirements.py3.windows.txt

Regarding the setup.py files, there are 118 packages should be detected.
But actually, SBOM file only include 40 packages.
We already had a meeting with SBOM team.
But they don’t know why missing packages and they use component detection to list all the packages in SBOM file.
and they suggest contacting your team for help.

As we communicated in email,
So Today we want to have a quick meeting to debug why component-detection task cannot find all the packages in setup.py (setup dot py file)


according the log here: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=1402322&view=logs&j=e725b3e9-648f-510f-a0a1-f18bdc151d12&t=ea579b3c-b4c1-59de-db37-e3a24fdd50a7
We can see component detection only found tools/(slash)setup.(dot)py file.

And because our project is a little bit complex and we need to support multiple platforms so we have mutiple requirement.txt (requirement dot txt files)
So can component-detection add a parameter for example `files_to_detect` to specify multiple files to detect?
For example, when we build package: we need to specify all setup.py files but except azure-cli-testsdk/setup.py, and one requirements.py3.$platform.txt file
And can also add this parameter to azure devops pipeline task ? Maybe about this we should ask SBOM Team I am not sure.
